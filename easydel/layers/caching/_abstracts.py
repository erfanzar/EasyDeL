"""Abstract base classes for caching systems in EasyDeL.

This module provides the foundational abstract classes that define the interface
for all caching implementations in EasyDeL. These abstractions enable different
caching strategies (transformer KV-cache, paged attention, state-space models, etc.)
to share a common interface while allowing for architecture-specific optimizations.

The caching system is built on a three-tier hierarchy:
1. Metadata classes that store configuration parameters
2. View classes that manage cache state for individual layers
3. Cache classes that orchestrate multiple views across all layers

Key Classes:
    BaseCacheMetadata: Abstract base for cache configuration metadata
    BaseRunTimeMetadata: Abstract base for runtime metadata during computation
    BaseCacheView: Abstract base for single-layer cache management
    BaseCache: Abstract base for multi-layer cache orchestration

Design Principles:
    - Functional updates: All cache modifications return new instances
    - PyTree compatibility: All classes use auto_pytree for JAX integration
    - Type safety: Strong typing with generics and protocols
    - Extensibility: Easy to add new caching strategies

Example:
    To implement a new caching strategy, extend the base classes:

    >>> class MyCustomMetadata(BaseCacheMetadata):
    ...     my_param: int
    ...
    ...     @classmethod
    ...     def create(cls, my_param: int) -> MyCustomMetadata:
    ...         if my_param <= 0:
    ...             raise ValueError("my_param must be positive")
    ...         return cls(my_param=my_param)

    >>> class MyCustomView(BaseCacheView):
    ...     # Implementation details
    ...     pass

class BaseCacheMetadata(ABC):
    """Abstract base class defining the interface for cache metadata.

    This class serves as the foundation for all cache metadata implementations.
    Metadata objects store static configuration that defines how a cache should
    be initialized and operated. They are immutable after creation and can be
    safely shared across multiple cache instances.

    The metadata pattern separates configuration from state, allowing:
    - Validation of parameters at creation time
    - Reuse of configurations across multiple caches
    - Serialization of cache configurations
    - Type-safe parameter passing

    Concrete implementations must:
    - Define all required configuration fields as class attributes
    - Implement the create() factory method with validation
    - Use the @auto_pytree decorator for JAX compatibility
    - Ensure all fields are immutable types or frozen dataclasses

    Attributes:
        All attributes are implementation-specific and should be documented
        in the concrete class.

    Note:
        The @auto_pytree decorator makes this class compatible with JAX's
        PyTree protocol, enabling it to be used in JAX transformations.

        providing a centralized location for parameter validation and
        initialization logic. It should be used instead of direct instantiation
        to ensure all metadata objects are properly validated.

        The factory pattern allows for:
        - Complex initialization logic beyond simple assignment

class BaseRunTimeMetadata:

    Runtime metadata captures dynamic information that varies during model
    execution but isn't part of the permanent cache state. This includes
    temporary computation state, indices, masks, and other ephemeral data
    needed during cache updates.

    Unlike cache metadata (which is static configuration), runtime metadata:
    - Changes frequently during model execution
    - Is specific to individual forward passes
    - May not need to be preserved between calls
    - Often contains computation intermediates

    Common uses for runtime metadata:
    - Current sequence positions and offsets
    - Batch-specific indices and mappings
    - Temporary buffers for computation
    - Attention masks and patterns
    - Memory management information

    Concrete implementations should:
    - Keep fields lightweight and computation-focused
    - Avoid storing large tensors unless necessary
    - Use appropriate JAX dtypes for indices (int32)
    - Document which fields are required vs optional

    Note:
        This class intentionally has no abstract methods, as runtime
        metadata requirements vary significantly between cache types.
        Implementations should add fields and methods as needed.

class BaseCacheView(ABC):

    A cache view represents the cache state for a single layer in a neural
    network. It encapsulates the layer-specific cached data (e.g., key/value
    pairs for attention, conv/SSM states for Mamba) and provides methods to
    update this data during inference.

    The view pattern allows:
    - Layer-specific optimization and sharding
    - Independent cache management per layer
    - Flexible cache formats for different layer types
    - Efficient memory layout for each layer's needs

    Key responsibilities:
    - Store cached states for one model layer
    - Track the current position/index in the cache
    - Update cache with new computed states
    - Apply quantization if configured
    - Manage memory layout and sharding

    Design principles:
    - Functional updates: Methods return new instances, not modify in-place
    - Layer isolation: Each view is independent of others
    - Type flexibility: Support both dense and quantized representations
    - Sharding aware: Integrate with JAX's sharding system
