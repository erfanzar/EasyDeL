"""Quantized linear layers for Mixture-of-Experts models.

This module provides placeholder implementations for quantized MoE linear layers.
These layers combine the memory efficiency of quantization with the computational
benefits of Mixture-of-Experts architectures.

Note:
    This module is currently a placeholder. Full implementations of quantized
    MoE linear layers are planned for future releases. For non-quantized MoE
    layers, see the _linear_moe module.
